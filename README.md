# Learning OpenGL

The goal of this repo is just to track my progress during the 
[LearOpenGL "course"](https://learnopengl.com).

The end goal is to be able to get into the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)

## Running the code

If you want to try out the code make sure you have the dependencies installed. Then

-   Clone the repo
-   Navigate into one of the folders
-   Create a build subdirectory by for example using `mkdir build`
-   Move into the build subdirectory
-   Run `cmake ..`
-   Run `make`

That's it. Now you just need to run the bianry created. For example the name of
the binary created for hello_triangle would be `hello_triangle`.

## Dependencies

-   Cmake
